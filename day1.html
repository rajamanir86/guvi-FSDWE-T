Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP/1.1: The servers repeatedly sent and received requests for a single HTML page, engaging the browser each time. For instance, the page will load on index.html upon the first request.
Once more, it establishes a connection to load images. As a result, the performance is extremely slow, and the data is being transferred in text format.

HTTP/2: HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format.
it works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests. HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. it compresses the header. 
The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.
